      <h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>

      <p>Nice of you to visit my site! Let me introduce myself, my name is Bram Koop (22) and I was born and raised in Klazienaveen in Drenthe (NL). Meanwhile, I have been living in Groningen for some time to be able to fully focus on my personal development. After successfully completing my Pre-University education at Carmel College in Emmen, I started a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Groningen. I have since graduated for this in February 2023.</p>

      <p>In my spare time, I enjoy gaming or playing the accordion. I also enjoy going out with my dog Sam. It is important for me to find a balance between my personal growth and my private life.</p>

      <p>Alongside this sunshine, unfortunately, there is also a dark side. In 2002, I was diagnosed with a brain tumour, for which I am still under treatment and monitoring. However, this challenge has never stopped me from pursuing my passions and achieving my goals. I believe in overcoming obstacles and turning difficulties into strength.</p>

      <p>On this website, I like to share my experiences and projects. I invite you to explore my portfolio and discover more about my work and interests. If you have any questions, are interested in collaborating or just want to have a chat, don't hesitate to contact me!</p>

      <p>Let's explore the world together, discover new opportunities and inspire positive change.</p>
