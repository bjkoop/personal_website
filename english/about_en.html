            <p>This page gives you an insight into who I am, what drives me and what my passions are. I invite you to read on and get to know me better. Should you have any questions or want to know more, I am always open for a conversation. Let's discover together what the future holds!</p>

            <h2>Youth</h2>

            <p>My name is Bram Koop. I was born on 9 June 2001 in the village of Klazienaveen (NL). As a child, I grew up in a nice family together with a younger brother and sister. In addition, pets have always been a part of our family. I currently have a dog of just one year old, Sam. This funny and playful little dog adds an extra dose of joy and excitement to my life.</p>

            <h2>Challenges and Perseverance</h2>

            <p>At a young age, my life took an unexpected turn when I was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the junction of my optic nerves in 2002. The treatments were intense and I had to undergo three surgeries, undergo radiotherapy and endure various forms of chemotherapy. Unfortunately, this resulted in the loss of my left eye and limited vision in my right eye. In addition, my pituitary gland became damaged, necessitating lifelong medication.</p>

            <p>This illness brought many challenges, both physical and emotional. But I have learnt to be resilient and use my perseverance to stand tall. Despite the setbacks, I am determined to pursue my dreams and live a meaningful life.</p>

            <p>During my treatments, I learned to prioritise my health and adjust the pace of my life. Although it was difficult at times, I always had the support of my family and friends.</p>

            <h2>From primary school to University</h2>

            <p>After a childhood filled with hospital visits, but also very fun things, I threw myself fully into my education. After completing my primary schooling at St Henricusschool in Klazienaveen, I went to Carmelcollege in Emmen for Pre-University education. In the upper grades, I chose the profiles Nature & Health and Nature & Technology, while also taking computer science as an elective. This was my first introduction to the world of programming and technology.</p>

            <p>With a great drive to learn and a passion for technology, I started the bachelor's programme Artificial Intelligence at the University of Groningen after my Pre-University education. Because daily travelling from Klazienaveen to the campus in Groningen became too hard for me after a year, I decided to live in Groningen after the first year of study. This provided more free time that I could put to good use for my intensive education. During this course, I dove deep into the world of data and learned to work with different programming languages and platforms, including C, C++, Python, R, Matlab, Netlogo and Javascript. It was an exciting time full of new discoveries and challenging experiences.</p>

            <h2>Stacking Shelfs, Catering and Telecoms</h2>

            <p>At 16, the search for a part-time job started. After filling shelves at the Jumbo in Klazienaveen for a year, I ended up at the zoo in Emmen. Here I worked in catering for almost four years. It was a fantastic experience in which I learned to deal with responsibility, a diverse group of people and to work in a dynamic environment.</p>

            <p>However, travelling back and forth between Groningen and Emmen was becoming increasingly difficult and I decided to look for a new challenge closer to home. That's how I ended up at the Belsimpel office. Currently, I am still working here, where I deal with the processing of return packages and handle customer questions and complaints during the day. In this environment, I can further develop my knowledge and skills.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>

            <p>Besides my academic endeavours, I also have several hobbies. One of my favourite pastimes is exploring new things with friends. It gives me a chance to relax and experience new things. In addition, music still plays an important role in my life. Although I had to give up my music lessons for my university studies, I still enjoy listening to music and occasionally pick up the accordion or bass guitar to play some myself.</p>

            <h2>In conclusion</h2>

            <p>This is a glimpse of my story so far. Despite the challenges I have faced, I am determined to pursue my dreams and make a positive impact. I believe perseverance and passion make anything possible, even in the face of setbacks. I would like to thank everyone for reading my story. With enthusiasm, I look forward to what the future holds and what new opportunities and adventures will come my way. Thank you for reading.</p>
